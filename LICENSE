These sources were developed by a team consisting of Leo Geissmann,
Christian Jacobi, Urs Ammann, Svend Erik Knudsen, and others under the
direction of Niklaus Wirth at the

   Institut für Informatik,
   ETH-Zürich
   CH-8092 Zürich

They were licensed to Ulm University in 1983 using the attached license
agreement (see file "License-Agreement"). Section 1.4 of this license
allows us to distribute the sources including our changes to third
parties under a sublicense, i.e. you are bound to the very same license
agreement if you download and use these sources.

The attached sources (subdirectory "src") were derived from the Modula-2
Multi-Pass Compiler version C18 as of 1981. Some minor changes were done
by me, Andreas F. Borchert, to adapt the compiler to my self-developed
Lilith emulator and its UNIX environment. These changes are put under
the very same license agreement.

There is no handling charge for this package. Please note that I make
this available as a historic document. There is no warranty for this
program, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
