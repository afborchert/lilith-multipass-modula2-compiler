                         License Agreement

concerning use and distribution of the program

   MODULA-2 Multi-Pass Compiler, Implementation for Lilith

subsequently called the compiler for the programming language between

   ________________________________________________________

subsequently called the licensee, and the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology in Zürich (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule),
subsequently called ETH, the licensor.

1. The license

1.1. ETH grants the licensee the right to use the compiler for its
employees, customers, or students.

1.2. The licensee obtains the right to use the compiler for any of its
requirements (education, production, demonstration) at no cost, except
for the initial handling charge.

1.3. The licensee agrees not to charge any "software cost" for the use
of this compiler to its paying customers.

1.4. The licensee does not obtain the right to sell the compiler nor its
modified versions for commercial profit without further agreement with
ETH. He is allowed, however, to further distribute the compiler to third
parties under the same conditions (sublicense and handling charge).
Sublicensing implies issuing a copy of this License Agreement.

1.5. ETH has no obligation to "maintain" the compiler, i.e. to adapt it
to new operating systems, nor to extend the language Modula-2.

2. Documentation

2.1. ETH will make available its documentation at production cost, and
retain the copyright for it.

2.2. ETH grants the licensee the right to produce its own manuals,
handbooks, or other documentation under the provision that ETH's
authorship of the language and its compilers is explicitly mentioned.
In particular, it must be mentioned that Modula-2 and the compiler
were designed and developed at the Institut für Informatik, ETH Zürich.

3. Rights and Authorship

3.1. The license has the right to adapt the compiler to its own
computing environment. He agrees, however, not to alter the compiler
in such a way that the language accepted by the compiler is changed.
The reference document is the report Modula-2, contained in N. Wirth,
Programming in Modula-2, Springer-Verlag, 1982.

3.2. Extensions of the language are not considered as changes. However,
the licensee agrees to report planned extensions to ETH; he is discouraged
from making substantial extensions in the interest of program portability.

3.3. If the licensee derives another compiler from the one subject to
this license, he agrees to report its availability and, if requested,
to make it available to ETH under the same conditions as stated in this
license.
